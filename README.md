Machine Learning Notes
======================
This repo contains my tests and notes about Python code from different books
about machine learning and deep learning, mostly based on scikit-learn and PyTorch

* [Python Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](pml3/)
* [Deep Learning with Pytorch](dlwpt/)
* [PyTorch Tutorials](pytorch_tut/)

## Machine Learning Frameworks and Tools
* [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/)  
* [TorchServe](https://pytorch.org/serve/)  
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)  
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
* [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/)
