Machine Learning Notes
======================
This repo contains my tests and notes about Python code from different books
about machine learning and deep learning, mostly based on scikit-learn and PyTorch 

* [Python Machine Learning, 3rd Edition](pml3/pml3.md)
* [Deep Learning with Pytorch](dlwpt/)
* [PyTorch Tutorials](pytorch_tutorials.md)
