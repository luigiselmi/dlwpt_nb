    "# Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "The kind of neural network that we have seen so far are fully connected, that is each unit of a layer is connected through  weights to all the units in the following layer. If n is the number of units of the first layer, and m the is the number of units of the second layer, the connections, or weights, between the two layers are represented by a matrix of rank nm. The number of weights in a fully connected multilayer perceptron increases rapidly if we add more than few layers to our network. Another problem of a fully connected layer is that it is not translation invariant (see also the [dlwpt](../dlwpt/ch8/dl_with_pytorch_ch8_convolutions.ipynb) folder for more info)."
